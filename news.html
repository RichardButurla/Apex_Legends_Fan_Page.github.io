        <h2> <span class="techniqueHeader"> <u>Movement Techniques</u> </span> </h2>
        <p2> <span class="movementParagraph">In Apex Legends, there are many movement techniques that can provide a huge advantage in the arena. Other techniques may be very
            minor or situational, but there are many to learn. Some range from bunnyhopping, to wallbouncing, and even punching the ground for a boost.
            Here are (in my opinion) some of the best movement tech in Apex Legnds:</span></p2>
        
       <h2><span id="techniqueHeaderLeft">Bunny Hopping:</span></h2>
       <p2> <span class="techniqueTextLeft">
           When you heal in Apex Legends, you are slowed to a walking speed that can leave you quite vulnerable.<br> 
           However, if you slide while healing you can keep some speed and move fast.<br> The bunny hop works on this concept.
           If you are able to hold slide and jump at the correct moments<br> while moving left and right, you can even heal on flat land while moving!<br>
           Here is a video:

       <h2><span id="techniqueHeaderRight"> Wall Bounce:</span></h2>

       <p2><span class="techniqueTextRight">
        Wall running doesent generally exist in Apex like for instance, Titanfall.<br> However, there is a technique that allows you
        to bounce off walls. This is the wall bounce. <br>In general, it works by slide jumping towards a wall at a 45 degree angle,<br> and then jumping
        just as you hit the wall.This is very useful for jumping over terrain instead of climbing.

        </div2>

        <h2><span id="techniqueHeaderLeft">Tap Strafing:</span></h2>

        <p2> <span class="techniqueTextLeft">
           A very strange but very useful mechanic is the tap strafe.<br> In Apex Legends, momentum is kept in one direction only mid-air. <br>
           However, tap strafing allows you to keep moment and change direction mid air.<br> Only problem is that this mechanic requires a bind to operate.
            It works by tapping forward very<br> fast while  moving and looking left or right.
