        <p> <span class="apexBannerText"> Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale-hero shooter game developed <br> by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. <br>
            Before the match, players form into two- or three-player squads,<br> and select from pre-designed characters with distinctive abilities,<br> known as "Legends".
            Search for weapons and supplies before <br>attempting to defeat all other players in combat.
            The available play area <br> on the island shrinks over time, forcing players to keep moving or else <br> find themselves outside the play area which can be fatal.<br>
